###Check your environment
To make sure everything works as expected, install and run the KDoctor tool (KDoctor works on macOS only).
In the Android Studio terminal or your command-line tool, run the following command to install the tool using Homebrew:
```
brew install kdoctor
```
If you don't have Homebrew yet, install it or see the KDoctor README for other ways to install it.
After the installation is completed, call KDoctor in the console:
```
kdoctor
```
