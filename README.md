## App structure

Star Wars App project includes 3 modules:

### shared

This is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications, that is, the code you share between platforms.
This shared module is also where youâ€™ll write your Compose Multiplatform code. In shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/App.kt, you can find the shared root @Composable function for your app.
It uses Gradle as the build system. You can add dependencies and change settings in shared/build.gradle.kts. The shared module builds into an Android library and an iOS framework.

### androidApp
This is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system. The androidApp module depends on and uses the shared module as a regular Android library.

### iosApp
This is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application. It depends on and uses the shared module as a CocoaPods dependency.
